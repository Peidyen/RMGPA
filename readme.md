# RMGPA

**Ronco's Morphogenetic Programming Architecture**  
_A living, evolving software system inspired by biological development._

## 🧬 Overview

RMGPA is a new programming paradigm that models software as dynamic, self-organizing systems—mirroring cells, tissues, and morphogenetic fields found in biology.

This architecture introduces:

- **Cells** with identity, memory, roles, and internal organelles
- **Morphogenetic Fields** that guide structural and behavioral development
- **Goal-driven behavior** for declarative reasoning
- **Self-healing and regenerative** mechanisms
- **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** support for intuitive goal declaration and structural control

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Ionide-fsharp extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp)

### Build & Run

Clone the repository and run the console app:

```
git clone https://github.com/Peidyen/RMGPA.git
cd RMGPA
dotnet run --project RMGPA.CLI
```

Expected output:

```
Cell cell-001 maintaining energy >= 0.800000
```

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept                 | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Cell**                | A self-contained computational unit with role, state, and organelles |
| **Organelle**           | Functional component inside a cell (e.g., memory, control logic) |
| **Morphogenetic Field** | A gradient-based or topological field that shapes development |
| **Goal**                | Declarative target or condition that cells evaluate and act upon |
| **Regenerative Memory** | Persistent structures used to rebuild and heal broken cells or tissues |
